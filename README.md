# Extraction & analysis of data in CSV files

The mission of this project was to create summary reports from very large data sets (over a million lines) in CSV files, and then print those reports to text files. 

Using a Python script, the project required opening the csv file, extracting data, making the necesary analysis, and then exporting the formatted summary report to a text file. 
I'm so glad to participate this kind of exciting project, as it's a startup I feel a little difficult. But I'm not worried cause you're there for me all the time.
